    <h1>The Problem </h1>
    <p> Online shopping has only one final frontier to conquer - the ability to check the sizing of the clothes. </p>
    <p> This problem can be solved if we create a website in which users can input their personal sizes and be able to instantly
      get notifications or notices whether something will fit them as various stores have varying sizing rulers. </p>
